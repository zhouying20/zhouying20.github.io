I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Artificial Intelligence at the Shandong University (SDU), Jinan, China. I received my PhD in 2025 from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), where I worked in the Chinese Information Processing Laboratory under the supervision of <a href="https://www.icip.org.cn/team/heben/">Prof. Ben He</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in 2020.

My recent research focuses on the generation and understanding mechanisms of large language models, with particular interests in AI-generated text detection and safety, controllable synthetic data generation, and model reasoning interpretability.

I am actively looking for master students, research assistants, and visiting students. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating (<a href="mailto:yingzhou@sdu.edu.cn">yingzhou@sdu.edu.cn</a>).

研究聚焦于大语言模型、数据合成、安全与可解释性。现招收硕士研究生和科研助理，欢迎对人工智能和大模型研究有热情的同学加入团队！
